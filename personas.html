          <h1> Introduction </h1> 
          <p> <i>Personas and Storyboarding</i> is a project I have done as a part of my CSCI1300: User Interface and User Experiences course at Brown University. 
            My task was to analyze an interface by observing real-life users, creating personas, and storyboarding. 
            I chose to work on an ordering kiosk available at a local boba tea place: Ten One Tea House.
          </p>
        </div>    
    </div>

      <div class="desc-container">
        <h1> Description of the Interface </h1> 
        <p> Ten One Tea House has a self-order kiosk machine available as an alternative to ordering in person. 
          Customers were able to choose between the two, but recently kiosk has been the only method of ordering. 
          It aims to shorten the checkout lanes and helps customers select their drinks as it offers images and some time to think.
        </p>

        <p>
          The self-ordering kiosk has two components: a touchscreen and a card reader. 
          The customers start by touching the screen to reach the ordering interface. Here, they can see the menu with images. Once they choose, they get to customize their drink by its size, milk choice, toppings, and sugar and ice levels. 
          Then, they click “add to cart,” which takes them back to the main menu, where they now have the option to “checkout.” 
          Customers are then prompted to enter their phone numbers, add a tip, and use the card reader to complete the transaction. 
          Finally, there is a screen where customers can claim points and are given their order number. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Below, the kiosk machine and a page from the self-ordering interface are illustrated:

    <h1> User Behavior and Interviews </h1> 
    <p> To better understand user experience, I observed and interviewed five customers. 
        While four interviewees were Brown University students, the other one was a local, who was no longer in college. 
        While this sample is not representative of everyone using a kiosk, it is pretty accurate for Ten One Tea House, as their customers tend to be Brown students due to their proximity to campus. 
        Below are my observations, questions, and a summary of customer answers.

    <h2>Observations on User Behavior </h2>

    <h2> User Interview Questions and Responses </h2> 
    <h3>Ten One offers two ways to order in-store: a self-checkout option via the kiosk or an in-person option via the cashier. Which one do you prefer and why?</h3>
    <p> Some customers chose to use the kiosk either because it presented all the options visually and explicitly or when the in-person line was too long. Others chose the in-person option because they believed that it was faster and more convenient: the cashier would quickly get the order, and there would be no need to click “a hundred buttons on the kiosk.”</p>
    
    <h3>If you were to use the kiosk, what would you expect your experience to be like?</h3>
    <p>All customers emphasized the importance of having an intuitive interface that clearly presents all options. While some mentioned that they would like to be able to complete the transaction without interacting with anyone, others noted that they would be more likely to choose the kiosk to have more time to deliberate all the options. </p>

    <h3>Do you think the interface for the kiosk is intuitive? Was there anything confusing about the interface?</h3>
    <p>Customers thought the interface was generally intuitive, mainly because it was similar to Snackpass–a mobile ordering app; however, they had some points of critique. They found restarting the current order or removing items from the cart to be complicated. The placing of some of the descriptions led to misunderstandings. </p>

    <h3>What do you think can improve the user experience? </h3>
    <p>Some customers mentioned that the interface could be redesigned to make the menu seem less overwhelming as there were “way too many” options to pick from. They also suggested having prices listed closer to add-on options would improve their experience. Finally, customers would like to have a more clear indication of where the cart is located on the screen. </p>

    <h3>If you were to implement new features, what would you add? </h3>
    <p>Most customers would like to have calorie information listed next to each drink. Some suggested having an “alternative” suggestion for items that are out of stock. They also thought that some customization options should have a default selected, as completing all the questions was cumbersome. Furthermore, everyone would like to receive an estimate waiting time when they receive their order number.  </p>

    <h1> Personas </h1> 
    <h2>Persona 1: Stressed Stella</h2>
    <p>     
      Stella is a college student in her junior year and has all the midterms squeezed into two days. 
      She is rushing to her class and wants to get her drink as soon as possible. 
      Because there was no line by the kiosk, she chose to self-order. 
      However, they are out of brown sugar boba, her favorite topping for her go-to tea. 
      She doesn’t know what the other options are and how well they would go with her drink. 
      There are no suggestions on the interface, so she has to make a random choice that might ruin the tea. 
      She finally chooses one and rushes through other customizations, but the “add to cart” button takes her back to the main page. 
      She is frustrated by the lack of intuitiveness and the time she has lost.

      <i> This persona is a good example of a usual customer at Ten One Tea House. 
        Due to its location, its customers tend to be Brown University students, 
        and college students tend to get more stressed and less patient as the semester progresses. 
        They also need caffeine and would appreciate a good drink.

    <h2>Persona 2: Curious Benjamin</h2>
    <p>     
      Benjamin is a retired Providence local. On his daily walks, he comes across a tea shop that his grandson has mentioned.
      He wants to give it a shot, but the cashier line is closed, so he has to order by himself through the kiosk.
      He doesn’t know anything about boba, is overwhelmed by the number of tea choices, and gets anxious as people wait for him to order. He ends up choosing one of the drinks that are listed as popular. 
      Now, he has to customize his drink but doesn’t know his topping and sugar level preferences.
      He wishes there were suggestions or default selections to make it easier for him. After having some difficulty, he finally finds the buttons and puts in the information that would take him to checkout. 
      Finally, he just needs to put his card in, but he doesn’t know how to insert it into the reader. Thankfully, a student behind him n notices his struggle and helps him finish the process.

      <i> This persona is almost an outlier among the regular customers of Ten One Tea House. Benjamin is an older adult with very limited technology and self-ordering experience.
        However, he presents a good case for the intuitiveness of the interface, as a good UIUX design aimed at the general public should be easy to understand and follow.
